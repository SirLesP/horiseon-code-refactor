Edited on local machine after creation in main on GitHub
Can I update it without getting into a horrible twist?

If I can it will form the core of my actual README.md for the challenge.

*** Added on GitHub
Yes, a simple git push sends to the default repo (and branch I guess).

Now can I pull it back down to local
*** End

Success, and a simple git pull brings it down from default. Note that local git doesn't watch the GitHub repo, hence the danger of other people's changes causing trouble. Not critical for this task where I'm working on my own.

Next step is to populate with the working files. Either locally and push to remote or remote and pull to local.
